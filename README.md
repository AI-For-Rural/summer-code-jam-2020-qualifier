# Summer Code Jam 2020: Qualifier

To qualify for the upcoming Summer Code Jam, you'll have to complete a qualifier assignment. In the assignment, you will be asked to write an `Article` class that could be used to represent an article published on a website. Please read the instructions carefully and submit your solution before the deadline with your sign-up. Also note that there's a test suite available that you can use to test your solution before you submit it.

## Qualifying for the Code Jam
The qualifier assignment has three sections of increasing difficulty:

1. [Basic Requirements](#basic-requirements)
2. [Intermediate Requirements](#advanced-requirements)
3. [Advanced Requirements](#advanced-requirements)

To qualify for the Code Jam, your solution has to **pass the basic requirements**. However, we do want to urge you to at least try the intermediate and/or advanced requirements if you think you can tackle them. We will publish our solution for the qualifier after the deadline has passed.

## Test Suite
To help you test your solution before submitting it, we've written a basic test suite that tests if your code passes the requirements. In principle, if your solutions passes the basic requirements section in this test suite, you should qualify for the Code Jam.

It's perfectly fine to have a look at the tests that we are going to run (see [test_qualifier.py](test_qualifier.py)), but do note that we will run the tests with different data to ensure that solutions were not written specifically for the included tests.

### Running the Test Suite

To run the test suite, first download and place the files [`test_qualifier.py`](test_qualifier.py) and [`run_test.py`](run_test.py) in the same directory as the file containing your solution. After having done so, open a terminal/command window with that directory as the working directory and run:

```
python run_test.py <your_filename_here>
```

**Note:** You may have to replace `python` with the command you use to run Python from the command line. If you're not sure and are using Windows, try `py` instead of `python` if `python` doesn't work.

The test suite has been tested with Python 3.7 and Python 3.8.
